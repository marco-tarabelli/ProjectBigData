# Sensor Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates temperature sensors and Docker-based sensors, generating random temperature data and publishing it to Kafka topics and MQTT brokers. The system uses Docker containers to simulate a real-world environment with a Kafka message broker, a Zookeeper coordinator, and MQTT messaging.

The application is designed to:
- Load sensor configuration from a YAML file.
- Set up Docker containers for Kafka and Zookeeper.
- Manage sensors using Python classes.
- Publish temperature data to Kafka topics and MQTT brokers.

## Features

- **Configurable Input**: The engine reads sensor data configuration from a YAML file, allowing flexible and customizable simulation of various sensors.
- **Docker Integration**: Docker containers are used to simulate the sensors, facilitating scalable deployment.
- **MQTT Broker Communication**: Simulated sensor data is sent via MQTT, a popular messaging protocol for IoT.
- **Kafka Integration**: The system also supports Kafka for message brokering and ensures scalable data ingestion and processing.
- **Realistic Sensor Behavior**: The simulator reproduces realistic data behavior, such as fluctuating temperature readings from IoT sensors.

## Components

### Input Configuration
- The configuration is written in **YAML** format.
- Defines the behavior and characteristics of the sensors, such as sensor type, firmware version, data generation ranges, and the characteristic of Docker, Kafka and MQTT configuration

### Engine
The core part of the simulator, responsible for:
- Reading the configuration file.
- Instantiating Docker images (fetched from Docker Hub) for simulating sensors.
- Coordinating the containers.
- Passing input to the containers via Kafka and receiving output.
- Collecting outputs to create the final simulated message (as JSON).
- Publishing the simulated message to an external broker (e.g., MQTT).

### Docker Images
- Created by third parties (e.g., researchers at Unicam).
- Encapsulate the behavior necessary to generate sensor outputs.
- Interact with the engine to receive inputs (via Kafka) and send output back (via Kafka).
- Handle all background mechanisms for interacting with the engine.

## Architecture

The architecture is divided into several key components:

1. **Engine**: The core simulation engine that reads input configurations and manages data production.
2. **Input Configuration**: YAML-based configuration file that defines the behavior and characteristics of each simulated sensor (e.g., temperature range, frequency of data production).
3. **Docker Hub**: Docker images for the sensors are fetched from a public repository and instantiated as required.
4. **Kafka**: The engine interfaces with Kafka for publishing and subscribing to sensor data messages.
5. **MQTT Broker**: Data generated by the sensors is sent to an MQTT broker for further processing or real-time monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have installed the following:

- Docker and Docker compose
- Python 3.x
- Kafka
- MQTT broker like Mosquitto
- Required Python packages (`kafka-python`, `paho-mqtt`, `PyYAML`, etc.)

## Running the Project

### Steps to Run




1. **Install Dependencies**

   Install required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


2. **Build Docker Image**:
   To build the required Docker image, use the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t image_name .
   ```

3. **Set Up Docker Compose**:
   Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Create Kafka Topics**:
   Kafka topics must be created before starting the application. You can do this by entering the Kafka broker container and running the following commands:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it broker /bin/bash
   kafka-topics --create --topic topic_name --bootstrap-server broker:broker --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
   kafka-topics --create --topic topic_name --bootstrap-server broker:broker --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
   ```

5. **Start MQTT Broker**:
   Ensure your MQTT broker is running on the default port (1883). You can use a service like Mosquitto.
   ```bash
   On the directory of Mosquitto as administrator:
   net start Mosquitto
   ```

   
6. **Listen to MQTT Topics**:
   Use an MQTT client to subscribe to the right topic (e.g., `/mytopic/sens_temp_1`), and you will start receiving the sensor data.
   ```bash
   On the directory of Mosquitto
   mosquitto_sub -t topicname -h localhost
   ```

   
7. **Run the Application**:
   Once everything is set up, run the application:
   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```



## Usage

Once installed, you can:

- Simulate various types of IoT sensors using predefined YAML configurations.
- Modify the configuration files to simulate different types of sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity) or to use different configuration for Docker, Kafka and mqtt
- Send data to MQTT brokers and view real-time sensor data.

## Code Structure

### Configuration

The configuration is managed using a `config.yaml` file.

#### config.yaml

```yaml
description: a description   # This should be changed for each run

outputs:
  - type: mqtt  
    host: localhost
    port: 1883
    topic: "/mytopic/${PRODUCER_ID}" 
    frequency: 2
    frequency_count: 500

docker_config:
  image: finalimage
  docker_net: bigdataproject_bigdata_net
  kafka_broker: "broker:9092"
  input_topic: "temperature_input"
  output_topic: "temperature_output"
  keep-alive-ms: 1
  status: "OK"

producers:
  - id: sens_temp_1
    type: "temperature_sensor"
    data:
      name: "TM-873"
      fw_version: "1.0.0v1"
      temperature: "$_random.uniform(10.1, 25.5)"
      status: "OK"
  
  - id: sens_temp_2
    type: "docker_sensor"
    data:
      name: "TM-874"
      fw_version: "1.0.0v1"
      status: "OK"
```

This file defines the outputs, Docker configuration, and sensor details, such as their IDs and types.

### Docker Compose

#### docker-compose.yml

```yaml

    networks:
      - bigdata_net
```

### Application Code

#### application.py

The main entry point of the project is the `application.py` file. The `Application` class loads the configuration, initializes Docker containers, and sets up Kafka consumers and MQTT publishers.

```python

                        config=producer['data']
                    )
                )
            elif producer['type'] == 'docker_sensor':

                        docker_manager=self.docker_manager,
                        kafka_consumer=self.kafka_consumer,
                        mqtt_manager=self.mqtt_manager,
                        config=producer['data'],
                        keep_alive_ms=self.config['keep_alive_ms']
                    )
                )

        iterations = self.config['frequency_count']
        if iterations == -1:
            iterations = float('inf')

        self.controller = TemperatureController(
            sensor_manager=self.sensor_manager,
            iterations=iterations,
            config=self.config,
            kafka_consumer=self.kafka_consumer
        )

    def run(self):
        self.controller.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = Application()
    app.run()
